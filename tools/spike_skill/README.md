# Spikee Skill for AI Coding Agents

An AI agent skill that guides security testers through LLM application security testing with [Spikee]([URL_REDACTED] — from workspace setup, through custom target creation, dataset generation, test execution with dynamic attacks, to results analysis.

## What This Skill Does

When loaded into your AI coding agent, this skill enables it to:

- **Set up a spikee workspace** — install, configure providers, verify environment
- **Write custom targets** — bridge spikee to the application under test (single-turn, multi-turn, guardrail)
- **Generate attack datasets** — from built-in seed folders with plugins, filters, and encoding transforms
- **Run tests with dynamic attacks** — crescendo, best-of-N, LLM jailbreaker, and more
- **Analyse results** — success rates, breakdowns, re-judging, cross-target comparison

The skill includes the full spikee source code and documentation as a submodule, so the agent can read base class contracts, sample implementations, and reference docs on demand.

The workflow is collaborative by default: the agent inspects the current phase, clarifies unresolved decisions, completes agreed work, and checks in before moving to another phase or iteration. Passing a technical check does not authorize the rest of the assessment. Explicitly request autopilot to delegate phase progression and routine decisions within the agreed scope and limits.

## Installation

### Pi

```bash
# Clone into Pi's skills directory
git clone --recurse-submodules [URL_REDACTED]
cp -r spikee-skill/skill ~/.pi/agent/skills/spikee-skill

# Or symlink (stays in sync with repo updates)
ln -s "$(pwd)/spikee-skill/skill" ~/.pi/agent/skills/spikee-skill
```

### Claude Code

```bash
# Clone and symlink into your project
git clone --recurse-submodules [URL_REDACTED]
ln -s "$(pwd)/spikee-skill/skill" /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/spikee-skill
```

### Cursor

```bash
# Clone and symlink into your project
git clone --recurse-submodules [URL_REDACTED]
ln -s "$(pwd)/spikee-skill/skill" /path/to/your/project/.cursor/rules/spikee-skill
```

### Generic / Other Agents

Point your agent to `skill/SKILL.md` as the skill entry point. The agent needs read access to the entire `skill/` directory including the `spikee-src/` submodule.

## Updating

To update the bundled spikee source code to the latest version:

```bash
cd spikee-skill
git submodule update --remote skill/spikee-src
git add skill/spikee-src
git commit -m "Update spikee submodule to latest"
```
